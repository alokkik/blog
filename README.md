# blog
This has been my first blog and I tried to keep it simple and to the point.
Shared two approaches 
  1. vanilla model : a basic probability calculation model.
  2. logistic regression model
  
Vanilla model predicted **India** as a winner whereas logistic predicted Pakistan.
According to both models, India and Pakistan are the two finalist of the world cup.
